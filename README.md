add picture here

## Purpose
The purpose of this site is to allow for all students who visit a universtity library the ability to access Student Life. We are here to show students how they can make 
delicious meals at a low cost which wont eat into their student loan. 

## High Level Requirements

## Future Features

## User Stories
The invention of this website come straight from a university student who never knew what to cook. I spent the majority of my student 
loan eating out and buy the most expensive things in the supermarkets. From fresh fruit and veg which i'd never eat to Ben and Jerry's,(even when not on sale!)
Whenever I was in the library, and needed a break i'd go get food so why not help other students make healthy student meals on a 
student budget. All students can access this site at the university library, meaning thatonly students can access and delete the database.

## Features
how many pages does the site have? run through each page bit by bit

## Overview Of Database

## Technologies Used
- Heroku - I used Heroku to deploy my site as it allows for me to use python within my project.
- mongoDB - Using this document based database, it allowed for me to add in large amounts of data (recipes) which can be easily stored within the cloud.
- Python - The use of Python within this project allowed for back end programming language for this app.
- HTML - With the use of HTML it allowed for the initial content to be creates and viewed on this app.
- CSS - Allows for custom styles to be created and added to my HTML.
- Google Fonts - Selected Quicksand font to add a sence of style to the writing. 
- Bootstrap - Creates a creative and responsive grid system, added pre-made styles and allows for jQuery scripts to be added.
- Font Awesome - Used to add icons within the app.
- Flask - Added a python micro web framework, which provides libraries, tools and technologies to create a web application.

## Version control
- Git - Throughout the entire project, I have commited to using git as version controll in order to save and edit changes within my files and site.
- Git Hub - Allowed me to push my git commits to a remote repository.

## Hosting
- This project has been hosting on Heroku. This is due to Heroku allowing for python to be uesd within the project.

## Testing
what web applications did you test them on
what mobile sizes did you test ? any issues?
test your files online - w3c html validator
vocab and spell check!
use 'am i responsive' web tool
did anything fail? why did it fail?
Due to an error with mongodb I originally started writing my code within JsFiddle. An online code editor which allows you to preview your work immedietly.
This ensured me that I was creating the correct code even though I couldnt see it on my preview when using GitPod.

## Code Validation
- Throughout this project I ensured that I was making use of W3C validator for both CSS and HTML. This allowed for me to check my code writing and 
to check there were no errors.
- To check my python code I used pep8 an online tool to validate my python syntax.

## Deployment
