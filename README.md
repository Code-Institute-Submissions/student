add picture here

## Purpose
The purpose of this site is to allow for all students who visit a universtity library the ability to access Student Life. We are here to show students how they can make 
delicious meals at a low cost which wont eat into their student loan. 
## High Level Requirements
## Future Features
## User Stories
The invention of this website come straight from a university student who never knew what to cook. I spent the majority of my student 
loan eating out and buy the most expensive things in the supermarkets. From fresh fruit and veg which i'd never eat to Ben and Jerry's,(even when not on sale!)
Whenever I was in the library, and needed a break i'd go get food so why not help other students make healthy student meals on a 
student budget. All students can access this site at the university library, meaning thatonly students can access and delete the database.
