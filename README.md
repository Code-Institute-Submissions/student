add picture here

## Purpose
The purpose of this site is to allow for all students who visit a universtity library the ability to access Student Life. We are here to show students how they can make 
delicious meals at a low cost which wont eat into their student loan. 

## High Level Requirements
The creation of this website allows for users to ... 
1. Access up to 3 categories of foods ie. Dinner, Breakfast and Protein Meals.
2. Display the recipes within time order eg. Breakfast, Lunch/Dinner then Protein Meals for those how want extra help getting in shape.
3. Allow each recipe to be displayed seperately to have a full screen view, showing the ingredience and instructions.
4. Allow users to edit, delete and submit new recipes. 

## Future Features
Future features which I will implement when I have more time will be ...

1. Allowing users to log in to the site and log out. Meaning that only they can edit, delete and submit their recipes.
2. Create a rating system that allows for users to rate recipes from 0 to 10.
3. Create a feedback request form so that the author of a recipe can see how well they are doing. 
4. Create a commenting section allowing for users to suggest improvements/feedback on recipes. 

## User Stories
The invention of this website come straight from a university student who never knew what to cook. I spent the majority of my student 
loan eating out and buy the most expensive things in the supermarkets. From fresh fruit and veg which i'd never eat to Ben and Jerry's,(even when not on sale!)
Whenever I was in the library, and needed a break i'd go to the shops to get some food ... so why not help other students make healthy student meals on a 
student budget. All students can access this site at the university library, meaning thatonly students can access and delete the database.

## Features

## Technologies Used
- Heroku - I used Heroku to deploy my site as it allows for me to use python within my project.
- mongoDB - Using this document based database, it allowed for me to add in large amounts of data (recipes) which can be easily stored within the cloud.
- Python - The use of Python within this project allowed for back end programming language for this app.
- HTML - With the use of HTML it allowed for the initial content to be creates and viewed on this app.
- CSS - Allows for custom styles to be created and added to my HTML.
- Google Fonts - Selected Quicksand font to add a sence of style to the writing. 
- Bootstrap - Creates a creative and responsive grid system, added pre-made styles and allows for jQuery scripts to be added.
- Font Awesome - Used to add icons within the app.
- Flask - Added a python micro web framework, which provides libraries, tools and technologies to create a web application.


## Wireframes
these can be seen in their own folder located in......... here is a link ()

## Version control
- Git - Throughout the entire project, I have commited to using git as version controll in order to save and edit changes within my files and site.
- Git Hub - Allowed me to push my git commits to a remote repository.

## Hosting
- This project has been hosting on Heroku. This is due to Heroku allowing for python to be uesd within the project.

## Testing
what web applications did you test them on
what mobile sizes did you test ? any issues?
test your files online - w3c html validator
vocab and spell check!
use 'am i responsive' web tool
did anything fail? why did it fail?

Due to an error with mongodb I originally started writing my code within JsFiddle. An online code editor which allows you to preview your work immedietly.
This ensured me that I was creating the correct code even though I couldnt see it on my preview when using GitPod.

## Code Validation
- Throughout this project I ensured that I was making use of W3C validator for both CSS and HTML. This allowed for me to check my code writing and 
to check there were no errors.
- To check my python code I used pep8 an online tool to validate my python syntax.
